# WinForms-Calculator

This is a clone of the Windows 7 calculator. This project uses Windows Forms UI framework.






## What are the limitations?

The calculator can be used for simple arithmetical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The project still has a bug: when using the keyboard, the "CE" button takes the value of the last key pressed.


## Screenshots
Here is a little preview of the interface
